<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

#### Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=697481393609113810&permissions=8&scope=bot) to invite Garlic Bread to your server

With my private Discord server slowly rising in members count, I had to face the cold hard truth...\
Something was still missing...
So I made this bot to fill both metaphorical holes in the server and in my heart.

Implemented features:
 * Custom role name and color
 * Hot-swappable modules (cogs)
 * Physical storage (.grlk files)
 * Cloud storage (e.g. for Heroku's free tier hosting)
 * Purge messages
 * Uwu

### Built With

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
* [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Setup

1. Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/VladCuciureanu/garlic-bread.git && cd garlic-bread
```
2. Install requirements:
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3.1 Persistent storage setup:
```
Use this if you have a dedicated VPS or if you're hosting it on your own server or PC.
No pre-setup is needed. Just skip to step 4 and follow the on-screen instructions.
```
3.2 Ephemeral storage setup:
```
I added this for budget bot hosts. For example, Heroku's free tier.
This setup takes a bit more time to setup but not too much.

 1. Setup a dedicated storage text channel. It can be in your discord server
or in an auxiliary discord server. It can even be the DM text channel between you
and Garlic Bread, but that takes a bit more tinkering in order to get the channel ID.

Note: To prevent data-loss, make sure only Garlic Bread can post there and no other
posts are present there.

 2. Copy that channel's ID. 

 3. Add the following environment variables (config vars):
GARLIC_TOKEN: {Your Bot Token}
GARLIC_STORAGE_CHANNEL: {Your dedicated text channel's ID}
```
4. Run bot.py:
```sh
python3 bot.py
```
5. If all went well you should see something like this:
```
Successfully logged in and booted...!
Logged in as ----> {Your bot's username and #}
ID: {Your bot's user ID}
Version: {Discord.py version}
```
