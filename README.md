<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

#### Click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=697481393609113810&permissions=8&scope=bot) to invite Garlic Bread to your server

With my private Discord server slowly rising in members count, I had to face the cold hard truth...\
Something was still missing...
So I made this bot to fill both metaphorical holes in the server and in my heart.

Implemented features:
 * Custom role name and color
 * Purge messages
 * Uwu
